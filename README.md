# "How much your smartphone knows about you"
In this project I tried to extract some information about the smartphone user as possible. The goal was to use the accelerometer, gyroscope to perform activity recognition to identify the physical activity, such as walking, standing that a smartphone user is performing. I used simple logistic regression to identify activities.

# "Movie Recommendation System(MRS)"
In this project I created a basic content based movie recommender. It takes the input as a movie title and recommend the top 10 movies from the top 250 rated movies according to IMDB dataset. I used the cosine-similarity function. This is one of the metric that we can use when calculating similarity between users and contents.
